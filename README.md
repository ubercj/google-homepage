This is the first project in The Odin Project's curriculum, and it's the very first time I've ever made a project using HTML and CSS!

The goal of this project is to recreate the Google homepage, trying first to recreate the elements using what I know, then using "Inspect Element" on the model page, and then finally using Google itself to find out how to do things.

It doesn't look perfect, but I'm pretty happy with what I was able to figure out.
